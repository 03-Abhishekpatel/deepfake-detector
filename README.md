# 🕵️‍♂️ Deepfake Detector

A machine learning and computer vision-based project designed to detect deepfakes in videos or images. The system analyzes facial landmarks and visual inconsistencies to determine if a face has been digitally manipulated.

## 🔍 Features

- Detects deepfake images and videos
- Uses facial landmarks and computer vision techniques
- Real-time frame analysis (if video input is supported)
- Alerts if tampering is suspected
- Easy to integrate or extend for larger systems

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- dlib / MediaPipe (for face detection/landmarks)
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on implementation)
- Flask (if deployed as a web app)
